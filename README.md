# Web App Vulnerability Scanner (Learning Project)

A small, educational scanner you run only on targets you own or have explicit permission to test.
It provides a Flask web UI to submit a target URL, crawls the site (breadth-first, limited depth/pages), and will run modular checks (SQLi, XSS, CSRF) with a developer-friendly report.

Ethical use only: Scanning third-party systems without written permission may be illegal. Use DVWA, Mutillidae, WebGoat, or your own apps for testing.
